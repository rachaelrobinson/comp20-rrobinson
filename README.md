The Purpose of this Git Repository:<br />
	To serve as a portfolio of my work throughout this class.<br /><br />
Favorite lab or assignment:<br />
	My favorite assignments were mapchat and the security assignment. I really enjoyed mapchat because that was the first time I really started to get the hang of things and learned to follow javascript functions. I also really enjoyed the security assignment because I'd never been aware of how vulnerable many sites are and the security flaws in even big company websites. It really made me begin to think about different ways that websites can be attacked. <br /><br />
How far I have grown: <br />
	Starting at day 1 I only had a limited knowledge of html and a beginning knowledge of servers, clients, and javascript. Now, I'm by no means a master in any of these, but I have learned a lot more about them. I had no idea what jQuery was or what an API was or how to use it. I now feel more comfortable looking into using API's and reading their documentation to see how they work. <br /><br />
Most Important Things I Learned this Semester:<br />
	Never ever trust user  - as seen in assignment 4. I learned that one can never trust user input and that the code must be created defensively to avoid malicious attacks. Not only does each part of the code need to be implemented correctly, but when taking in user input, it must be cleansed before being dealt with rather than just accepted. <br />
	Don't reinvent the wheel - although I also learned this one in Comp40, this really came into play once we began the final project. Although we as a team did a lot of styling on our own, we scratched at the surface of bootstrap and saw all that it could do (and all the space it could take up). Additionally, when struggling to work through a bug in our code or to understand an API, we looked to examples for advice or to gain a better understanding.<br /><br />
Where I Would Like to Go Now:<br />
	I would really like to delve deeper into user experience and design as well as develop my web programming skills even further.
